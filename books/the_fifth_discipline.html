			Let the riview begin.

			This is probably the worst written book I have ever read, as far as how the material is presented. I had a really hard time following and feel like I have to read it twice just to get everything. I think there is a some really good information here, but it is so convoluted, I think I am missing a lot of it. The two appendecies are very good, they actually list out the five diciplines directly as well as all the standard systems archetypes, strange that they are there, as soon as I realized that, I went there and read them before continuing.

			I feel like there are some good aspects that I want better books to describe those topics, and ignore the rest of the stuff.

			There are some good story points, like talking about the beer game, it's a good thing to talk through, as an example. I like the style of how he wrote that, every once in a while he gets back to writing in that style, but then reverts back to the standard monotone dialogue.  About the beer game, I don't get why people make the mistake of using accounting principles to solve such an easy problem.  Clearly the solution is to ask for as much beer as you can sell in one week, while keeping some extra.  Why do we allow a backlog to build up especially when I have no idea about how the actual demand works out?  (there was a name for this in the book like "no change", but I don't remember exactly.) It seems that he was attempting to make a point, but his example doesn't help there. Did he really bring this up in coversations with prospectice learners. Later he mentioned three microworld examples. These are really good, and actually having more of these may have provided some value.

			I don't understand the structure diagrams at all, it's like he doesn't understand what arrows, delay boxes, and words represent. Sometimes it works because he means then to be "causes" but other times it makes no sense, I think he needs a lesson in feedback loops because they don't seem very clear to him, or at least I'm not convinced he understands how to represent anything at all. When discussing with others the confusing way the book is setup, they had mentioned "that's how managers think".  So ugh, I mean I want the book to broken down in a straightforward way, I have no idea where each chapter was going (and a lot of them were way to long). It seemed like he tried to introduce things at the point in which he felt the reader was ready to take on the challenge of understanding what he was about to say, rather than providing each concept in a detailed way, and all the concepts in the same way.

			Is systems thinking the fifth dicipline, I get the other four diciplines in part III, so that seems all out of order. Or is the book about all five diciplines together, then why aren't they talked about first in the book and then explain each one how it relates to the others...

			Some of this was really obvious and I feel like I have been practices these all along, although its really good to corroborate it, and now I know about how others see it. What I would like is more books on systems thinking, preferably organized in a nice way that talk about common and uncommon ones, examples, and how to go about idendentifying the problem and attack vectors, and then what the solution is. Is there anything like that?

			I think this was a recommendation to read for me, I think some parts of the book I wasn't really ready for. Some parts were perfect, and others were behind my current visions. I think I need something to fit the space between where I am in systems thinking and where this book comes out as. I want to look for that though, I also have a friend who is a systems engineer, I think, so I may try to consult him.  Have you read this book yet?
