Let the riview begin.

This is probably the worst written book I have ever read, as far as how the material is presented. I had a really hard time following and feel like I have to read it twice just to get everything. I think there is a some really good information here, but it is so convoluted, I think I am missing a lot of it. The two appendecies are very good, they actually list out the five diciplines directly as well as all the standard systems archetypes, strange that they are there, as soon as I realized that, I went there and read them before continuing.

I feel like there are some good aspects that I want better books to describe those topics, and ignore the rest of the stuff.

There are some good story points, like talking about the beer game, it's a good thing to talk through, as an example. I like the style of how he wrote that, every once in a while he gets back to writing in that style, but then reverts back to the standard monotone dialogue.  About the beer game, I don't get why people make the mistake of using accounting principles to solve such an easy problem.  Clearly the solution is to ask for as much beer as you can sell in one week, while keeping some extra.  Why do we allow a backlog to build up especially when I have no idea about how the actual demand works out?  (there was a name for this in the book like "no change", but I don't remember exactly.) It seems that he was attempting to make a point, but his example doesn't help there. Did he really bring this up in coversations with prospectice learners. Later he mentioned three microworld examples. These are really good, and actually having more of these may have provided some value.

I don't understand the structure diagrams at all, it's like he doesn't understand what arrows, delay boxes, and words represent. Sometimes it works because he means then to be "causes" but other times it makes no sense, I think he needs a lesson in feedback loops because they don't seem very clear to him, or at least I'm not convinced he understands how to represent anything at all. When discussing with others the confusing way the book is setup, they had mentioned "that's how managers think".  So ugh, I mean I want the book to broken down in a straightforward way, I have no idea where each chapter was going (and a lot of them were way to long). It seemed like he tried to introduce things at the point in which he felt the reader was ready to take on the challenge of understanding what he was about to say, rather than providing each concept in a detailed way, and all the concepts in the same way.

Is systems thinking the fifth dicipline, I get the other four diciplines in part III, so that seems all out of order. Or is the book about all five diciplines together, then why aren't they talked about first in the book and then explain each one how it relates to the others...

Some of this was really obvious and I feel like I have been practices these all along, although its really good to corroborate it, and now I know about how others see it. What I would like is more books on systems thinking, preferably organized in a nice way that talk about common and uncommon ones, examples, and how to go about idendentifying the problem and attack vectors, and then what the solution is. Is there anything like that?

I think this was a recommendation to read for me, I think some parts of the book I wasn't really ready for. Some parts were perfect, and others were behind my current visions. I think I need something to fit the space between where I am in systems thinking and where this book comes out as. I want to look for that though, I also have a friend who is a systems engineer, I think, so I may try to consult him.  Have you read this book yet?

When discussing microworlds (Meadowlands), the only we got to an interesting conclusion is that conditions to a simulation were created. I argue that given that simulation with arbitrarily constrained conditions would always yield that result.  The real interesting and therefore pertinant learning opportunity that could be offered by the book would explaining how those conditions were created. I can conclude the same result, even before the simulation started, but what I am interested in is how to create an experiement that would convince others a priori of a problem, without using intuition. If it was just a simulation, how was it simulated, were these just artibtrary metrics and historical data that responded well to increase service quality.  Finally, the problem with the example is that is in not clear why the Meadownlands employees where able to come to a conclusion about collaboration at all, let alone a direction to fix the company.

I think instead of providing real guidance and training when it comes to systems thinking, the author instead provides some example cases, and the forces the solution down your throat.  In a lot of ways he isn't wrong, but it's unfortunate that he provides the solutions is such a roundabout and misleading way:
* Training new members is very important and covers long term gain, compared to short term gain of reducing prices. I refuse to believe this will always be the case, at least without looking into the exact systems model thinking. People Express Airlines failing to discover that quality of service was more important has significantly influenced the author. It seems that every problem in the book can be solved by increased quality.  If that really is the case, prove it to me instead of concluding automatically by "simulation games" that this will solve the problem. Perhaps the simulation game has introduced a fixed opinion into the author's mind about this idea, and the game is really at fault.  The solution to this really should be: don't take on more work than you can handle, it is like trying to compete with a mega company, you won't beat their revenues simply because you don't have the resources, not because your business is worse.

Okay maybe I don't have another good example, but now I'm forced to look back at what the whole book was about. The Fifth discipline, systems' thinking, but that isn't what the book is about.  It starts off the way, kind of.  Mostly mentioning scenarios of problems or learning disabilities, so perhaps the book is about "learning organizations".  Which also could be good, but lacks real focus. At the end of the book, the author revisits interviews where defining a "learning organization" is the crux of the issue.  But somehow gets derailed and talks about how there is now another new concept "direct experience".  It really seems that having solid focus is lacking here, and really detracts from the main point/points.  This could easily have been a book about one of but not all:
* Systems Learning
* Importance of Quality
* Innovation in Enterprises
* Space the Final Frontier
* Microworlds Simulations: What They Are And How They Can Help You!

There are a lot of new ideas in this book, but they are thrown around everywhere. These views will help me pick something better in a related field.
